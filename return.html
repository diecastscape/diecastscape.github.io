  <h1>Return & Cancellation Policy</h1>

<p>As our products are handcrafted and made in limited quantities, we do not offer returns once an order is confirmed.</p>

<p>Cancellations are accepted only before the product is shipped.</p>
  
<p>To be eligible for any damage-related assistance, a complete unboxing video recorded from start to end without any cuts is mandatory.</p>

<p>If you receive a damaged product, please contact us within 24 hours of delivery along with clear images and the required unboxing video.</p>

<p>Refund or replacement, if applicable, will be determined only after review and mutual discussion based on the provided evidence.</p>

<p>Each case is reviewed individually to ensure fairness.</p>
